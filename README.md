# python-programs
This repo contains a couple programs that I thought it would be cool to program.

Doomsday.py is the Doomsday algorithm, which I learned in Number Theory at University of North Texas.

paycheck.py is a program I designed to see what was supposed to be taken out of my paycheck and used it to observe if the Federal Government took out too much or not enough.
