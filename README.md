# python-programs
This repo contains a couple programs that I thought it would be cool to program.

`Doomsday.py` is the Doomsday algorithm, which I learned in Number Theory at University of North Texas.

`paycheck.py` is a scirpt I designed to see what was supposed to be taken out of my paycheck and used it to observe if the Federal Government took out too much or not enough.

`EngToPyg.py` takes English input and translates it into Pig Latin.

`PygToEng.py` takes Pig Latin and translates it back into English.

`webcrawler.py` is a simple script that I developed to talk about web scraping for a lightening talk for the 2018 Dataquest Chicago off-site.

`webcrawler_txt` is the data pulled by `webcrawler.py`.
